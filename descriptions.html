<p>Hello, I hope you are doing well with your last semester in nash at vandy! I've decided to create something. I tell myself its an art piece, but I really just don't know a better word for it. Basically I want to collect experiences. I want to codify what feeling human is like. I want documents, i want pictures, I want stories, i want riddles. I want things you've made, things you've been ruminating on for year but just don't know where or who to say it to. I want cultural references, I want this thing to be as densely packed with references and internal logic, and breaking the fourth wall, and being withholding as possible. I want it to feel like an organism.

I know this is strange sounding. I have no idea how to express it. Here is a link to what I have so far. Let me know what you think, and if you would like to contribute. - Self</p>

For the art, are you thinking digit, visual, physical? Are there any requirements or exclusions you have in mind?</br>
Art is art, it's in the eye of the beholder</br>
Also, you hate rules, so why would you have rules - MK</p>
