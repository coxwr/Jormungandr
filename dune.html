<p> Dune is a seriously underrated movie,book,and concept. I first became aquainted with the Dune universe in college. 
 My friend with the same name as I showed me 'Jodorowsky's Dune', a documentary on the greatest movie never made. Well,
 after that I was hooked, it lasted for a few days then laid dormant again. Just abou every year I was at Vandy with that same friend 
 we would watch Jodorowsky tell us of his vision, and see his quirks and we would laugh and marvel at his legacy. Again it laid dormant, 
 that is until I moved to Washington DC after graduating from Vanderbilt. I picked up a copy of Frank Herbert's Dune at a Barnes and Noble 
 somewhere in Tysons I think, and was hooked again.

<p> Sadly I couldn't resist and watched the film on Amazon, it was actually, i think, the first time I payed money to stream an old movie. 
But damn was David Lynch's vision of Dune good, he got the casting of Paul Muad-dib Atreides just right, and the imagery of those Guild 
Navigators floating in the great spice melange was as perfect as can be. But I'm not really here to talk about the merits of Lynch vs 
Jodorowsky, although I would pay to see Jodorowsky's take on Twin Peaks, I want to talk about the central tenet of Herbert's Dune: 
distillation and concentration.</p>

<p> On Arrakis the spice melange is produced. Melange fuels Dune's story. Melange really is the story. The Fremen who are native to Arrakis
have brilliantly blue eyes, because of prolonged exposure to trace melange in the air. The mentats which fill the role of computers drink a
wine made from grapes that have been in contact with the spice melange. Finally, the Guild Navigators have been immersed in high concentration
of vaporized melange, leading to severe physical mutations, and the ability to 'fold' space. Exposure to this spice is what has caused all
of the major accomplishments of this universe up until the time of Paul Muad-dib Atreides, till we become spectators.</p>

<p> what I previously described was distillation, the pulling out spice from the universe and using it. These 'sentient' races pull the 
spice from where it is produced, and distribute it across the galaxy. Whereas the sandworms do the opposite, from the air and sand on Arrakis,
they produce the spice after living countless human generations. Once a substance has been processed sufficiently it takes on some otherness
it takes on some new aspect; some new characteristic that is new yet perfectly encapsulating what it was. </p>
