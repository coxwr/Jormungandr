  <p> look at <a href="https://i.imgur.com/PfCd5mq.jpg">this</a> meme. how deep is it? how many levels of humor? </p>
  
  <p> First inspirations ? </br> So today we replaced the ladder to my parents' attic. I really want to take the old wooden ladder and make it into a planter 
(I'm kinda into gardening, as much as you can do in an apartment, and being environmentally cautious about my waste) </p>


<p> what about some sort of widget or plug-in that lets you watch a youtube video and make real time annotations to it. Then you send that 
  annotations file to your buddy who can now see what you think of the video. Then your bud sends one back, and so on. New way of interacting 
  with visual media? Will need EBJ's opinion. </p>
