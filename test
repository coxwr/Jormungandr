		<!-- I Hate that Gin has become a popular alchoholic drink. I don't drink gin and tonics because they are the cool drink to drink, I don't drink them because they taste good, I drink them because I hate myself and I want to feel like a british imperialist. My friend Riley first got me really into drinking gin in a social manner. Its a tasty liquid, if you like aromatic or floral flavors. My step-father's step-father (sorta, long story) always drank a gin and tonic on holidays or befor a family gathering, and he was sort of an austere gentle man. Realize i say gentle man and not gentleman, although he was also a gentleman. He was a chemical engineer for a while, and apparently did a good job off it because my grandmother is still living off his stock options almost a decade after he passed away. Oh well. -->
